    **** Bonus Challenge ****:
    Create a variable that stores the total number of eggs 
    and assign it 100. We want to fill as many baskets with 
    eggs as we can. Each basket can hold only 12 eggs.

    1) Write the Java code that will calculate how many baskets
    of 12 eggs we can fully fill. (Note: Think integer division)

    2) Write the Java code that will calculate how many eggs
    are left over after all baskets are filled with 12 eggs each.

    // Use integer division to give us the quotient when dividing by 12


    // use the modulus operator to give you the remainder.
